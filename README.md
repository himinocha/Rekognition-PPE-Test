## Amazon Rekognition: Workplace Safety

This is the final project of QTM350 at Emory University
by Jeremy Montgomery, Se Eun Kim, and Isaac Cha(Mino).

In this project, we will test Amazon Rekognition's functionality of PPE detection.
We currently have 10 stock photos of PPE. We will add more photos, as we dive deeper into our analysis.
Here is our basic achitecural diagram of our project:
